Javascript Challenge

**Version 1.5.0**

**Weather Dashboard App challenge activity.**

The aim of this project is to create a simple weather dashborad application that allows a user to search for a city's weather forecast and save those searched cities.

This project focuses on the use of javascript to create this application.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given a weather dashboard with form inputs, when I search for a city, then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
- When I view current weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
- When I view the UV index, then I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
- When I view future weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
- When I click on a city in the search history, then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
